It must remain as-is for use as a reference in a live presentation during LavaCon 2023.

The presentation is intended flseh out the whys and wherefores of building confidence, compliance, and a powerful engine designed to process whatever you throw at it. This skeletal template is a mere how-to demo of some of the points made during that presentation. "Demo not memo".  

Here's hoping this proves a valuable resource for jump-starting nano-teams, lone writers, and other overworked docs folks tasked with building a Knowledge Base. For truly turnkey solutions that will provide you a full-featured starting point, please review the [Resources](/.docs/team1/resources.md) article.
