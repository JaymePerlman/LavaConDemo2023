## How to use this repo

Clone it or fork it and do whatever you like to the copy. 
At this time I am not taking contributions, since I need this as-is to make my presentation at [LavaCon 2023](https://lavacon.org/)! ðŸ˜„ But after that, we'll see how it goes.

## What's in here?

- A [Project board](https://github.com/users/JaymePerlman/projects/1) with multiple views.
  -   All issues by title (a list)
  -   All issues by current status (Kanban style)
  -   All issues by sprint
  -   A calendar roadmap with a couple of tracking milestones
- The Project also has some built-in workflows to automatically add items and move them around when certain events occur.
- A few test Issues to populate the project and illustrate some points
- A few test PRs to populate the project and illustrate some cool features like Mermaid
- Some files so you can understand how the CODEOWNERS file works to protect content from unauthorized changes
- An Action workflow that automatically creates a new Sprint Ceremony issue containing an agenda template for a Sprint planning meeting every Tuesday. _(With an example option to change it to the first and fifteenth of the month if you run two-week sprints)_
