title: How to get the most out of this repo
---

This repo demonstrates various basic Actions and templates but is not a truly functional documentation site. For a fully-featured site, take what you've learned here and apply it to a Real Docs Template such as [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) which will give you a TON of actual docs-management functionality and other necessary features like navigation sidebars.

This repo is specifically designed solely to exercise and illustrate the points covered in my presentation at [LavaCon 2023](https://lavacon.org/) ðŸ˜„ in more depth.

## What's in here?

- A Project board with multiple views, a status board, and sprints for tracking, statusing, and communicating.
- The Project also has some built-in workflows to automatically add items and move them around when certain events occur.
- A few test Issues to populate the project and illustrate some points
- A few test PRs to populate the project and illustrate some cool features like Mermaid
- Some branch protections so you can start to understand how to protect your content from unwanted churn while still allowing easy contributions.
- An Action workflow that automatically creates a new Sprint Ceremony issue containing an agenda template for your Sprint meeting every Tuesday. _(With an example option to change it to the first and fifteenth of the month if you run two-week sprints)_
