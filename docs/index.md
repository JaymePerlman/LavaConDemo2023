## Disclaimer

This repo is specifically designed solely to exercise and illustrate the points covered in my presentation at [LavaCon 2023](https://lavacon.org/) ðŸ˜„ in more depth. 
It is not intended to be a truly functional documentation site. 

## What's in here?

- Many more [additional resources](./team1/index.md) for starting/continuing your journey.
- An entire article on the [proper usage of Labels](./team1/labels.md).
- The user's view of the "New Article" [issue template](https://github.com/JaymePerlman/LavaConDemo2023/issues/new?template=quick_doc.yml).
- The Project [tracking board](https://github.com/users/JaymePerlman/projects/1) with multiple views.
- A PR that contains [Mermaid code rendering a couple different charts](https://github.com/JaymePerlman/LavaConDemo2023/pull/5). The ultimate in maintain-able graphics -- Markdown goes in, and pictures come out!
- I've configured the `main` branch with basic [branch protections](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches) so you can start to understand how to protect content from unwanted churn without making it harder to contribute.
- A handy sample [Action workflow](https://github.com/JaymePerlman/LavaConDemo2023/blob/main/.github/workflows/create_weekly_sprint_notes.yml) that automatically creates a new Sprint Ceremony issue with an agenda outline for a Sprint meeting every Tuesday. It also contains an option to change it to the first and fifteenth of the month.
