Don't create an "angry fruit salad" of labels in random, meaningless colors. 

You'll note that every issue, as part of triaging the intake stream, is assigned **one** of each color of label in the [Project](https://github.com/users/JaymePerlman/projects/1). This is deliberate and very important. 

- Affected functionality area of the imaginary product (dark blue)
- Affected team (dark teal)
- The type of intake source (light blue)
- Current status (green)

Each color corresponds to a category or type so you can easily see when information is missing or duplicated. 

- An issue that has both a "Data Drop" AND a "New Article" label, which are both light blue, can't have come from BOTH sources. It's one or the other.
- If the issue has NO light blue label, then you immediately know that the intake source wasn't ever defined. [^1] 

## Accessibility

For accessibility purposes, add emoticons to labels, so they're not only different colors.

## Adding other label types

You can add any other type of label you need. For example:

- Sunsetting status for articles migrated from elsewhere that will need removal from their original location after publishing
- Assigned story points for measuring team velocity per sprint

## Watch for unnecessary labels

Keep in mind that many items such as assignees, reviewers, milestones, status, etc. are all tracked elsewhere already and don't necessarily need explicit labels. 
But you certainly can if you want to, and you can also use them to trigger more Actions.


[^1]: We track the source so that we can absolutely determine where an article's content came from. Was it part of a release, or part of a larger document, or did someone contribute it out of tribal knowledge?
